# Python-Practice
Inside this repository are solutions to Zybook/Code Wars/General practice problems.  This repo also includes projects I have completed for fun. I like to revisit and update these to stay fresh with Python related syntax and skills. I also like to review these to show myself how much I have improved since first beginning to learn whenever I become frustrated or stuck learning new material. I considered or would have considered most of these difficult right as I began to learn programming.
